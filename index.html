                In October 2014, Tufts began working with DTZ to develop a plan to restructure its janitorial staff, as required by the contract that the university and the agency signed over the summer. The administration hoped that the new plan would increase efficiency and sustainability, and was unsure whether or not it would involve job cuts. Members of TLC expressed concern both for the employees who could potentially lose their jobs as a result of the new system and for those who would remain, worrying that they might be overworked.

                  On Nov. 21, Tufts administration announced that the university signed a contract with DTZ. According to Vice President for Operations Linda Snyder, the contract set forth the university’s expectation to increase efficiency, the percentage of full-time workers and sustainability. The announcement was met with negative reactions from members of TLC, who responded by circulating a petition and holding a sit-in on Wednesday, Nov. 26.

               TLC staged a 33-hour sit-in in Ballou Hall to protest janitorial job cuts. TLC members and Executive Vice President Patricia Campbell signed an agreement that ensured there would be no job cuts before April at the earliest, and that both parties would be transparent throughout the process, among other provisions. The agreement ended the sit-in on Dec. 10, 2014.

                On March 10, representatives from the Tufts administration and DTZ hosted a meeting to introduce their plan to increase cleaning efficiency. At the meeting, anticipated cuts to Tufts’ part-time janitorial jobs were also announced. “DTZ’s program changes will reduce the number of part-time positions by about 35, [and] approximately 56 positions will change shift schedules,” Vice President for Operations Linda Snyder said in a statement to the Daily. Several protests organized by TLC and Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which represents the janitorial staff, followed over the next few weeks.

                At a public meeting, the Medford City Council unanimously approved a resolution to entreat Tufts to reconsider cuts to its janitorial staff. Councilors expressed concern for the staff reduction given the university’s plans to construct new buildings. Council Vice President Breanna Lugo-Koehn stated that the Council was concerned about how the cuts would affect the janitors, many of whom are Medford residents. After voting, the Council sent the resolution to Executive Vice President Patricia Campbell and Director of Community Relations Barbara Rubel.

                  On April 17, TLC organized a protest at the unveiling of the new Jumbo statue, an event that coincided with the first of three Jumbo Days for prospective students. As several speakers, including University President Anthony Monaco, addressed parents, alumni and current students who had assembled, protesters stood silently in front of the podium, with no acknowledgement from officials.

                Executive Vice President Patricia Campbell and Vice President of Operations Linda Snyder wrote an op-ed in the Daily in which they outlined the administration’s decision to restructure its janitorial services. They explained that a report from DTZ sparked the reorganization, as according to the contracting agency’s analysis Tufts is paying more for janitorial services than other nearby colleges and universities. They said that DTZ’s new "high-efficiency, labor-saving equipment” was factored into the restructuring, as were the new facilities that are presently being built. Campbell and Snyder also stressed that DTZ has instituted a hiring freeze in hopes of rehiring employees at other locations, and that the eventual number of cuts will be determined by SEIU’s policies and procedures.

                Five members of TLC announced announced an indefinite hunger strike and began an occupation next to Ballou Hall. They said that they are protesting in place of the janitors, who are restricted from striking by their contract. According to TLC, the hunger strike and occupation will continue until the administration delays the job cuts, which are intended to go into effect at the end of May 2015, until spring 2016.
